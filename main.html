Hi. I'm a Senior Data Scientist at the Climate Corporation, working on the Data Quality team. I'm
interested in working with sensor data and understanding quality errors introduced in the data collection process. 
<br>
I enjoy developing algoriths to identify and/or correct those errors, as well as building algorithms dependent on the signal in sensor data that are reliable in the face of these data quality issues. I am also interested/skilled at software engineering, machine learning, Python, Spark, implementing data science algoritms in production environments, and data visualization.
In my spare time I enjoy illustration, baking, and being outside.</p>
